Hi üëãüèº my name is [percy](https://percy-kappa.vercel.app/). I'm here to help you calculate percentages for your (weight) training.
As for now I can help you with two things:
- Calculate a series of predefined (45-95 and one custom) percentages for a 1 RM
- Calculate steps to build weight from start- to end-percentage based on a 1 RM

That's really all there is for now, a small Web-App built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Planned Features

- User-Accounts to store 1 RMs
- Automatic calculation of 2-10 RMs based on 1 RM and vice-versa
- Import/Export 1 RMs as Excel (cvs)

Anything you want to see on the list? [Let me know](https://sahli-interactive.ch/visitenkarte/emanuel-imhof).

If you want support my work, you can do this [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=XQHQ6TT37L496).

## Local Development

You can fork and/or clone me to make me your own:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m43nu/percy.git
cd ./percy

# install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# get the local server running
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
